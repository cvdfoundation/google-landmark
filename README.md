# Google Landmarks Dataset v2

**NEW**: Explore the dataset visually
[here](https://storage.googleapis.com/gld-v2/web/index.html).

This is the second version of the Google Landmarks dataset (GLDv2), which
contains images annotated with labels representing human-made and natural
landmarks. The dataset can be used for landmark recognition and retrieval
experiments. This version of the dataset contains approximately 5 million
images, split into 3 sets of images: `train`, `index` and `test`. The dataset
was presented in our [CVPR'20 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01804) and
[Google AI blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/05/announcing-google-landmarks-v2-improved.html).
A hierarchical extension of the dataset is presented in an under-submission
paper to the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. In
this repository, we present download links for all dataset files, baseline
models and code for metric computation.

This dataset was associated to two Kaggle challenges, on
[landmark recognition](https://kaggle.com/c/landmark-recognition-2019) and
[landmark retrieval](https://www.kaggle.com/c/landmark-retrieval-2019). Results
were discussed as part of a
[CVPR'19 workshop](https://landmarksworkshop.github.io/CVPRW2019/). In this
repository, we also provide scores for the top 10 teams in the challenges, based
on the latest ground-truth version. Please visit the challenge and workshop
webpages for more details on the data, tasks and technical solutions from top
teams.

As a reference, the previous version of the Google Landmarks dataset (referred
to as Google Landmarks dataset v1, GLDv1) was available
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/google/google-landmarks-dataset). It is no longer
available.

### `index` image licenses

All images in the `index` set have CC-0 or Public Domain licenses.

## Download `test` set

There are 117,577 images in the `test` set.

### Download the list of images and ground-truth

-   `recognition_solution_v2.1.csv`: CSV with three columns: `id` (16-character
    string), `landmarks` (space-separated list of integer landmark IDs, or empty
    if no landmark from the dataset is depicted), `Usage` (either "Public" or
    "Private", referring to which subset the image belongs to). Available at:
    [`https://s3.amazonaws.com/google-landmark/ground_truth/recognition_solution_v2.1.csv`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/google-landmark/ground_truth/recognition_solution_v2.1.csv).

-   `retrieval_solution_v2.1.csv`: CSV with three columns: `id` (16-character
    string), `images` (space-separated list of string index image IDs, or None
    if this image is ignored), `Usage` (either "Public" or "Private", referring
    to which subset the image belongs to). Available at:
    [`https://s3.amazonaws.com/google-landmark/ground_truth/retrieval_solution_v2.1.csv`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/google-landmark/ground_truth/retrieval_solution_v2.1.csv).

### Downloading the data

The `test` set is split into 20 TAR files (each of size ~500MB) containing
JPG-encoded images. The files are located in the `test/` directory, and are
named `images_000.tar`, `images_001.tar`, ..., `images_019.tar`. To download
them, access the following link:

[`https://s3.amazonaws.com/google-landmark/test/images_000.tar`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/google-landmark/test/images_000.tar)

And similarly for the other files.

#### Using the provided script

```bash
mkdir test && cd test
bash ../download-dataset.sh test 19
```

This will automatically download, verify and extract the images to the `test`
directory.

Note: This script downloads files in parallel. To adjust the number of parallel
downloads, modify `NUM_PROC` in the script.

### `test` image licenses

All images in the `test` set have CC-0 or Public Domain licenses.

## Checking the download

We also make available md5sum files for checking the integrity of the downloaded
files. Each md5sum file corresponds to one of the TAR files mentioned above;
they are located in the `md5sum/index/`, `md5sum/test/` and `md5sum/train/`
directories, with file names `md5.images_000.txt`, `md5.images_001.txt`, etc.
For example, the md5sum file corresponding to the `images_000.tar` file in the
`index` set can be found via the following link:

[`https://s3.amazonaws.com/google-landmark/md5sum/index/md5.images_000.txt`](https://s3.amazonaws.com/google-landmark/md5sum/index/md5.images_000.txt)

And similarly for the other files.

If you use the provided `download-dataset.sh` script, the integrity of the files
is already checked right after download.

## Extracting the data

We recommend that the set of TAR files corresponding to each dataset split be
extracted into a directory per split; ie, the `index` TARs extracted into an
`index` directory; `train` TARs extracted into a `train` directory; `test` TARs
extracted into a `test` directory. This is done automatically if you use the
above download instructions/script.

The directory structure of the image data is as follows: Each image is stored in
a directory `${a}`/`${b}`/`${c}`/`${id}`.jpg, where `${a}`, `${b}` and `${c}`
are the first three letters of the image id, and `${id}` is the image id found
in the csv files. For example, an image with the id `0123456789abcdef` would be
stored in `0/1/2/0123456789abcdef.jpg`.

## Baseline models

We make available the ResNet101-ArcFace baseline model from the paper, see
instructions
[here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/delf/delf/python/datasets/google_landmarks_dataset).

## Metric computation code

The metric computation scripts have been made available, via the
[DELF GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/delf/delf/python/google_landmarks_dataset),
see the python scripts `compute_recognition_metrics.py` and
`compute_retrieval_metrics.py`. These scripts accept as input the ground-truth
files, along with predictions in the format submitted to Kaggle.

## Dataset licenses

The annotations are licensed by Google under CC BY 4.0 license. The images
listed in this dataset are publicly available on the web, and may have different
licenses. Google does not own their copyright. Note: while we tried to identify
images that are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license, we make
no representations or warranties regarding the license status of each image and
you should verify the license for each image yourself.

## Release history

### May 2023 (version 2.1)

As an addition to the original dataset, we added hierarchical labels for
landmarks.

### Sept 2019 (version 2.1)

Ground-truth and labelmaps released. Note that the ground-truth has been
substantially updated since the end of the 2019 Kaggle challenges; it is not the
one that was used for scoring in the challenge.

We have re-computed metrics for the top 10 teams in the 2019 challenges (see the
Kaggle challenge webpages for precise definitions of the metrics):
